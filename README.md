# Ethical, Legal, and Professional issues
1.	Ethical Issue:

One issue that the YO app runs into in terms of the ACM Code of Ethics is that it does not “Contribute to society and to human well-being”. While the YO app is a fun way to communicate with friends, it does not contribute much to advancing society or human well-being. While it was not intended to do so, it still had the opportunity and did not capitalize on the opportunity to provide a benefit to humans.

Another possible issue is the “Be fair and do not take action to discriminate” part of the code of ethics. While the app itself does not discriminate against any of its users, it could be used by people to discriminate against each other. With the addition of the punctuation at the end of the “Yo’s” there exists the opportunity to send hateful messages to those that have angered you. This is a form of discrimination and bullying that can be levied against unsuspecting users of the app.

The last ethical issue that could arise is the “Respect privacy” part of the code of ethics. Since the ability to add punctuation to the end of messages now exists, there could be a way to figure out the type of connections that people have. This data could be mined by the company that runs the app and sold to social media companies and other entities that would have a vested interest in the way that you interact with people. This would be a huge invasion of the privacy of the users and certainly a violation of the Code of Ethics.

2.	Legal Issues

One legal issue stemming from the app is whether or not it is facilitating bullying. With the ability to send messages that could be interpreted as angry, it could be a way that users of the app can harass other users. A legal question would be whether Yo has a responsibility to protect its more vulnerable users from others.

Another legal issue is with the feature that allows you to send your location with a Yo message. If there are kids that are younger than 13, it could be a violation of COPPA laws that prevent people from preying on young children. Yo could be facing lawsuits from both regulatory government agencies and the parents or guardians of children that were tracked and harassed by older users.

The final legal issue that could be presented is with the ability to send pictures along with the Yo message. There are a myriad of issues that could come up, from privacy concerns when storing the photos to children sending pictures to adults. If the terms and conditions are not carefully written, Yo could be liable for many privacy infractions that occur sending the pictures.

3.	Professional Issues

One professional issue that could be related with the Yo app is that they do not do a good job in educating the users on the implications of sharing both pictures and their locations with one another. It is on Yo to ensure that the users are well informed under the ACM Code of Ethics.

Another potential professional issue from the Code of Ethics is ensuring that while developing and making updates to the app, the public good is always the main priority. The promise of money could lead to developments that take advantage of its users.

The final potential professional issue is the developments of systems that are not robustly secure. If they Yo app had a vulnerability that allowed its data to be breached, the hackers would have information on many users and their connections and type of communications with others.

The country that I chose was Russia. Under Russian Law, the right to data privacy is guaranteed to every individual. The biggest thing to consider in Russian law that is unique to the country is that personal data created by Russian citizens must be stored in physical servers located inside the country for a certain amount of time before they can be transferred out. This raises ethical concerns as this gives the Russian government an opportunity to censor posts that they deem dangerous. It also raises legal concerns because if a Russian was conversing with an American visiting Russia, the American data would be stored in Russian servers that could be accessed by the Russian government.
